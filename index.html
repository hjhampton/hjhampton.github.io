<h2>About Me</h2>H
<p>

My name is Hunter Hampton and I am a computer science major at Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford, Oklahoma.<br/>
I am expecting to graduate in May of 2022. I have asperations to make a career out of software engineering.<br/>
Computers are a major interest in my life and I am excited to continue learning about them and how to program them.<br/>
I have a basic fundamental understanding of the Java language, and some of my personal projects can be found here on this website!<br/>
I still have a lot to learn, and this site will be updated as I grow in my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of the realm of computers, I am an active member in <a href="https://www.swosu.edu/admissions/plc/plc-bios/class14/hunter.aspx">SWOSU's Presidential Leadership Class</a>,<br/>
and I helped coordinate the first annual SWOSU Game Developers Conference which took place on November 16, 2019.<br/>
Leadership plays an important role in my life and I am always working on improving those skills.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for visiting my site!
